# Team7_BlackJack
CSCI 4020 Team 7's blackjack application.

This repository seeks to accomplish the following:
* Let one person play BlackJack with the phone.
* The phone is the dealer.
* The player should start with some amount of money and be allowed to bet.
* If the user stops in the middle of a game and closes the app, when the app is reopened, the game should continue where it left off.
* The user should not have to guess what to do. The app should be designed in such a way that it is "obvious" how the game is played, even if they have never played Blackjack before.
* Add several ( > 5) images so that the app looks nice.
* At least three activities.
